= Introduction

This is a simple pure-Ruby driver for the 10gen Mongo DB. For more information
about Mongo, see http://www.mongodb.org.

Note: this driver is still alpha quality. The API will change, as will the
data saved to the database (especially primary key values). Do *_not_* use this
for any production data.


= Demo

  $ ruby examples/demo.rb

Mongo must be running, of course.


= Testing

  $ rake test

The tests assume that the Mongo database is running on the default port.


= The Code

Most of this code was transliterated from Geir Magnusson Jr's Java Mongo
driver, which can be found at
http://github.com/geir/mongo-java-driver/tree/master.

== Release Notes

I plan to remove the auto-generation of _id primary keys.

If you ran tests using code before release
http://github.com/jimm/mongo-ruby-driver/commit/4244f56ce6c7044a1ce096843eb991856422c0cc
then the DB API tests might fail the first time you run it. If that doesn't
clear up the failed test, you might have to delete your database. To do that,
type

  $ rm /data/db/ruby-mongo-test*


= To Do

* More code comments. More text in this file.

* Rake task for rdoc generation.

* Remove default _id generation.

* Introduce optional per-database and per-collection PKInjector.

* Synchronization.

* More tests.

* Implement Admin.

* See FIXME in db test.
