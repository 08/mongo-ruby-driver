= Introduction

This is a simple pure-Ruby driver for the 10gen Mongo DB. For more information
about Mongo, see http://www.mongodb.org.

= Demo

  $ ruby examples/demo.rb

Mongo must be running, of course.

= Testing

  $ rake test

The tests assume that the Mongo database is running on the default port.
